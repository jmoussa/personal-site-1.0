            UI/UX design involves planning the layout and structure of your website. 
            How it will look on mobile. How the user will interact with various components etc.
            Once that is decided, I generate a mockup (blueprint) of the site.

          <h2>Front End Development</h2>
          <div *ngIf='structure' class='service-details d-lg-none d-md-block d-sm-block d-block'>
            The front end is what the user will see and interact with. 
            This involves building out the display (ideally so that it matches the mockup).
            I focus on dynamic, interactive and intuitive web interfaces.

            The back end is where all the logic that connects to your business or brand will go.
            Sometimes this is not necessary (for example this site does not have a backend).
            You will require a back end if your site integrates with:
            <ul>
              <li>A Database (or anywhere you store your electronic records)</li>
              <li>3rd Party Service (e.g. Google Maps, Twitter Feed, Email/Messaging)</li>
              <li>Another CMS</li>
